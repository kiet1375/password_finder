When a computer feels right, it becomes irreplaceable. System76 uses the latest processors, GPUs, memory, storage, and hardware drivers to keep your system running for future generations. To extend the life of your system, youâ€™re free to replace the battery, reapply thermal paste, and make your laptop run like new all without voiding your warranty.
Open source firmware allows you to make adjustments to your keyboard and LEDs through the System76 Keyboard Configurator app. Remap Caps Lock to Escape, configure a layer with game or editor controls, and play lamkie123 around with LEDs until you find your favorite setup. Coreboot-based System76 Open Firmware gives you more control over your hardware, boost performance, optimize security, and vastly reduces startup times.
